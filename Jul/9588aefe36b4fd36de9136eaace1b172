By BO Staff Writer The commission of inquiry into state capture, which is headed by Deputy Chief Justice, Raymond Zondo, has been granted an extension on the time frame which the commission is required to complete its work. The period has been extended by 24 months, calculated from 1 March 2018. Zondo approached the North Gauteng High Court on 19 July to have the period extended. The working period of 180 days was recommended by former public protector, Thuli Madonsela, in the remedial action of her much talked about “State of Capture” report. The court order grants the president and various political and civil society formations the opportunity to oppose the extension should they wish to do so. If they wish to oppose, on 2 October they must “show cause… why the period of 180 days should not be extended by 24 months calculated from 1 March 2018.” “To give them this opportunity was important because the urgent application was brought without notice to them due to the urgency occasioned by the looming expiry of the 180 days,” the commission said in a statement. Those who may have concerns over other aspects of the commission (including the scope and time period which the term “State Capture” covers) will be disappointed as the commission chairperson only applied for an extension of the working period. The terms of reference of the commission still remain intact. In a meeting with the commission last month, the black consciousness political formation, Black First Land First (BLF), raised concerns regarding “the time frames which the commission will cover” and the role Madonsela’s State of Capture report will play in thr commission, cautioning the commission not to “apply a narrow interpretation of the terms of reference”.
