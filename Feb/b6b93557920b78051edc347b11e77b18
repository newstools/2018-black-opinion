By BO Staff Writer President Jacob Zuma says he has done nothing wrong and sees no reason why he should be recalled. Speaking on a one-on-one interview with the state broadcaster, SABC, Zuma said he disagrees with the ANC’s decision to recall him and does not understand the odd haste with which he is being removed from office. “It is the first time that I have a feeling that the leadership of the ANC is unfair… the ANC does not do things like that. I am not defying, I am just saying I am not agreeing [with the decision to recall],” he said. Much to the highly cited cased of former president, Thabo Mbeki, who was recalled by the ANC in 2008, Zuma revealed that he never agreed with that process but was over powered by the democratic majority in the debate. He says the decision to recall Mbeki, which resulted in splits within the ruling party, was detrimental to the party and need not be repeated. “At times I deployed soldiers inside countries. Deploying cadres is what I know best. But there are two posts you can’t deploy willy-nilly, President and Deputy President,” he said. Zuma said he proposed to the ANC NEC that he vacate office after June so that he can introduce newly elected ANC president, Cyril Ramaphosa, to the African Union and to BRICS leaders. The brave and defiant leader says he will release a statement to clarify his position on his recall soon. The process of removing the president of South Africa from power mirrors those of other leaders from other progressive nations across the world, including Brazil, Venezuela and Zimbabwe. The motion of no confidence against President Zuma is scheduled for tomorrow, 15 February, at 2pm. Watch the full interview below:
