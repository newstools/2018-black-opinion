By BO Staff Writer Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Julius Malema, surprised many this afternoon when he abandoned his response to the State of the Nation Address (SONA) speech with five minutes left on his allocated time. Sources have indicated to Black Opinion that Malema was instructed by his London handler, Lord Robin Renwick, to stop criticising Cyril Ramaphosa. The usually fiery Malema, who has made his political career out of milking the Marikana massacre, was reduced to Ramaphosa’s praise singer, while making empty feeble threats to the racist Democratic Alliance (DA). Observers say Malema stopped his speech short because he was worried that he may upset Renwick if he said one word out of script. Malema made a big deal about expressing his allegiance to Ramaphosa as president, including pledging support for Ramaphosa. This is out of kilter with Malema’s known animosity towards Ramaphosa primarily because of the Marikana massacre. Malema, who has previously referred to Ramaphosa as the Marikana “murderer”, was completely silent on Marikana in his SONA debate speech. This is suprising because Ramaphosa is associated directly with the Marikana massacre. Many feel Malema has betrayed the workers and widows of Marikana with his failure to hold Ramaphosa accountable. To give some radical posture to his speech, Malema warned the racist DA on land expropriation. This was a big bluff. The DA’s position is, and has always been known on land expropriation without compensation. Malema gave the DA political power whilst knowing this and now he is making empty threats to appear radical after failing to take Ramaphosa on. The EFF has been defanged of its ealier militancy as London controls more and more of its decisions and posture. The EFF has now become Ramaphosa’s poodle. Malema’s failure to use his five minutes shows how serious the London grip is over EFF.
