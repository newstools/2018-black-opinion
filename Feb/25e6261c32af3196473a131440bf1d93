Malema dished out tweet after tweet of who was reshuffled where, way before President Cyril Ramaphosa officially announced his new cabinet. Sources have revealed that Malema was tipped by white capitalist billionaire, Johann Rupert, at least an hour before the reshuffle was officially announced. Malema started of his reveal with this tweet, sharing that former finance minister, Malusi Gigaba, had not been removed from the cabinet. How do you keep Gigaba of all the people and talk about fight against state capture? — Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) February 26, 2018  Then he went on to reveal most of the cabinet: What makes Nomvula survive all the time? Now going to communications — Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) February 26, 2018  I thought DD’s issue was too obvious, he will be Deputy President. — Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) February 26, 2018  Gwede DMR — Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) February 26, 2018  Blade Transport — Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) February 26, 2018  Blade Transport — Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) February 26, 2018  Pravin Enterprise — Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) February 26, 2018  Police Cele — Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) February 26, 2018  J.E.F.F E.n.e.r.g.y — Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) February 26, 2018  “What’s my name” Malema quipped confidently after revealing Ramaphosa’s cabinet. What’s my name🤣😂🤣🤣😂 — Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) February 26, 2018  Many people have said Malema and Ramaphosa are linked to white monopoly capital through the Stellenbosch group of white capitalists and London’s Lord Robin Renwick. The information on who would be appointed could only come from a source who the president had to brief. Rupert leaked the list because he is not entirely happy with the new cabinet since it retained some known proponents of radical economic transformation. What can no longer be denied is the fact that Malema and Ramaphosa have the same handlers.
