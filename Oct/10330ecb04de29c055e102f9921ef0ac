By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published in the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) calls on the National Prosecution Authority (NPA) and the Hawks to speed up the criminal cases it has opened against FW de Klerk. This call is made urgent by reports that the former President FW de Klerk is hospitalized. On May 8, 2017 BLF laid 22 criminal charges against FW de Klerk. These are serious cases of mass murders emanating from several massacres. De Klerk didn’t go to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to confess his sins. He has no immunity from prosecution. There must be justice for hundreds, if not thousands, of people murdered by his regime. BLF will also write a letter to the NPA and the Hawks asking that they provide reasons as to why there has been no process in the cases opened against de Klerk. In the event that the NPA is not willing to prosecute de Klerk, then BLF will consider a private prosecution process in relation to him. BLF is worried that de Klerk will die with the truth!
