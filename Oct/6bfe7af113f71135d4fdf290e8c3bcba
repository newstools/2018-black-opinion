By BO Staff Writer This statement was previously published on the BLF website. Black First Land First (BLF) is not surprised that a forensic investigation has found that the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leadership helped to destroy VBS bank through corruption. The EFF was funded by a criminal, Adriano Mazzotti, after all, plus it’s leadership had bankrupted the province of Limpopo through corruption. BLF has always taken action to defend VBS. The destruction of VBS bank to fund the lifestyle of Gucci and Louis Vuitton cannot go unaccounted for. The EFF has been used by white monopoly capital to destroy the lives and careers of black leaders who are pro-Radical Economic Transformation (RET). EFF was never about ending corruption, that is why it’s the only party resisting the parliamentary bill that seeks to compel political parties to disclose their funders. The EFF is a corrupt enterprise that misleads the people by claiming to fight corruption. BLF demands that the EFF do the following without delay: 1. Apologize to the nation for destroying a black bank. 2. Fire Floyd Shivambu pronto. 3. Cooperate with police on the case of corruption BLF is opening against them. 4. Open their financial books to a forensic audit. 5. Subject their top 6 leaders to a lifestyle audit. 6. Pay back the money 7. EFF must disclose it received money from the VBS bank. BLF will open a criminal case against Floyd Shivambu. VBS must be defended against the corrupt vultures who mislead our people through claiming to be anti-corruption crusaders.
