By Tshepo Kgadima South Africans should brace for severe load shedding this winter. Coal stockpiles at several Eskom power stations are running at between 1 and 3 days. This is by design. I will provide realtime coal stockpile levels at various Eskom power stations on a daily basis from later this afternoon. Looting and profiteering are set to return with the use of over R1 billion of diesel fuel per month. Thavia Govender was returned to the position of Group Executive for Generation at Eskom in order to bring back load shedding so that the nation can be lied to again that South Africa needs Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers (REIPPs). Numbers donâ€™t lie though. Eskom generated and sold over 240,000 GWH in 2008 without 1 GWH from the Independent Power Producers (IPPs), yet today we are told we need IPPs when the same Eskom is selling 214,000 GWH of electricity.
