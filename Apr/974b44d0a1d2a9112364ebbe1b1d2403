By BO Staff Writer Africa News Network 7 (ANN7) and The New Age (TNA) Media previously owned by Oakbay Investments, have both been purchased by Afrotone Media Holdings (AMH) which is owned by Mzwanele Manyi. It is indeed pleasing that the media enterprise, AMH, is 100% black-owned. The Department of Communications has expressed its wishes that AMH would “become an independent, credible and diverse media broadcaster, providing an alternate viewpoint to national discourse”. Moreover the Minister of Communications, Nomvula Mokonyane, has condemned the “dim views, often discriminatory and unfair, which some sectors of the media and public have held against ANN7 and The New Age”. Also very significant is the fact that the deal between Oakbay Investments and AMH has addressed the concern by the former of the previously impending unemployment crisis. The jobs of over 500 workers employed in ANN7 and TNA have now been secured. The following is a media statement issued by the Department of Communications on 25 April 2017:  Also see below the press release of AMH issued on 21 April 2018:
