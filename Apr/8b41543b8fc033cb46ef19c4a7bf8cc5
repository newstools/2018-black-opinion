By BO Staff Writer The following statement was first published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) will be back in the Western Cape High Court tomorrow, on applications interdicting them from occupying farms “owned” by the colonial land thief, Johann Rupert. The movement will be represented by its President, Andile Mngxitama. The interdicts applied for are aimed at arresting the land revolution led by BLF in Franschoek and in other areas regarding productive white owned land. The movement is being stopped from expropriating land without compensation – land that is owned by Johann Rupert, whose interests lie in securing and perpetuating the benefits of the historical colonial theft of black lands. To this end, Rupert is seeking white justice in the colonial courts to ensure BLF does not take back the stolen land he is occupying.  The South African justice system is racist and will not allow itself to be used to expropriate white landowners. As we know the white landowner enjoys the protection of section 25 of the Bill of Rights. BLF remains committed to ensuring the return of all stolen land from the settler colonizer, including the likes of Johann Rupert and will not rest until revolutionary justice is served. The details of the court hearing are as follows: Date: 10 April 2018, Tuesday
Time: 09h00 am
Address: Keerom St, CBD, Cape Town Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee of (BLF NCC) 09 April 2018 Black First Land First Email:blackfirstlandfirst@gmail.com
