By BO Staff Writer The following statement was first published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) condems the conduct of the Democratic Alliance (DA), the Langeberg Municipality as well as the racist white neighbours who use apartheid tactics to ensure that the “Klipberg 136, Robertson Farm” owner, Gary Coetzee, is unable to build and create opportunites on his farm. A number of antics have been employed to make Mr Coetzee despondent and lose the property to land thieves. The most pertinent involves that of the DA’s Department of Water Affairs in Worcestor which refuses to issue a certificate of water rights – making it impossible for Mr Coetzee to apply for the allocated funding from the Department of Agriculture, which would result in economic development and job creation. Despite being in possession of an official mining permit and complying with the requirements of the National Environmental Management Laws Amendment Act (NEMA), the Langeberg Municipal Tribunal which comprises of 4 racist whites and a black person refuses to make a decision in favour of Mr Coetzee on the Land Use Planning Ordinance (LUPA) application; this despite making a decision that favors a white person who applied after Mr Coetzee. This had rendered mining impossible on the farm. BLF will write to the Langeberg Municipal Tribunal and demand that the application in terms of LUPA be granted immediately – and to this end that the Department of Water Affairs grants the Certificate of Water Rights without delay. BLF will also lodge official complaints with the South African Human Rights Commission, Equality Court of South Africa and Public Protector. In this regard we shall mobilize mass action to the Langeberg Municipality so as to ensure that development on Mr Coetzee’s farm is actualized. #TakeBackTheLand #EndRacism
