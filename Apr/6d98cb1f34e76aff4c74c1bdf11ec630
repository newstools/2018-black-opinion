By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Today, Black First Land First (BLF) vowed to continue its land expropriation programs on Johann Rupert’s farms. BLF did not oppose the application brought by Rupert to interdict our movement from taking 10 of his farms around Stellenbosch. The Western Cape High Court granted Rupert the interdicts but did not impose a cost order against BLF. We told Judge Meer that BLF will be continuing with its revolutionary program on the farms of Johann Rupert. We know that Rupert has more than 100 farms across South Africa (SA) which BLF is currently identifying for occupations. The Court order doesn’t apply to farms not named therein.  Furthermore, we affirmed our right to protest at any farm of Johann Rupert. That’s a fundamental right that BLF plans to exercise as and when we desire.  The struggle for land can’t be stopped! Land or Death! Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee (BLF NCC) 10 April 2018 Black First Land First Email:blackfirstlandfirst@gmail.com
