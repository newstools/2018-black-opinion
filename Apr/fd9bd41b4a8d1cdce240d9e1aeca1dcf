By BO Staff Writer The following statement was first published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) is saddened by the news of the passing of the Mother of the Nation, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Her legacy is that of a fighter, a mother to all oppressed blacks and a revolutionary. Despite all attempts to neutralize her, break her spirit and silence her, she remained committed to the struggle for black liberation. Even after the first democratic elections and the ushering in of so-called freedom, she used the strength she had left to face the institutional challenges of the new democracy and refused to be co-opted by the oppressors. We warn the public to be aware of the storm that will follow. A carefully co-ordinated series of stories and lies will dominate the media to discredit this struggle icon in the following days to come. They will try to convince us that a black woman is to blame for the circumstances of apartheid. No white media should pass judgement and tell us about TRC commissions when land thieves and apartheid war lords are roaming the streets of Stellenbosch. Rest in power Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Black women all over the world draw strength from your powerful spirit. It is our duty to continue the struggle, to restore black dignity and to emancipate ourselves by any means necessary.
