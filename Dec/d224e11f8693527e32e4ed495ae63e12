By BO Staff Writer The following statement was first published in the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Citizen News online platform is deliberately misrepresenting Black First Land First (BLF) to fuel black-on-black violence and to stop any attempt at black unity. BLF stated categorically and thus maintains that all black political parties must unite, including the African National Congress (ANC), Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), National Freedom Party (NFP) and others. However, BLF notes that the ANC of Ramaphosa has chosen the side of White Monopoly Capital (WMC). The fight still remains against WMC headed by Rupert, and not against the ANC. The Citizen has deliberately misrepresented BLF to stagnate black unity. BLF demands the Citizen change the misleading headline to express, “BLF Calls For Black Unity To Fight WMC”. If the Citizen refuses to change the misleading headline, BLF will write to the press Ombudsman and take direct action! It can not be that mainstream media cries victim when confronted for unfair, innacurate reporting but maintain the luxury to mislead!
