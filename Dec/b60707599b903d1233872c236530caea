The following statement was first published in the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) is outraged over the murder of Anele Ziko, the assault and attempted murder of two other young boys in Langeloop village in Mpumalanga by the racist settler colonizer Sarel Du Plessis. It is clear that the racist killer Sarel Du Plessis is an agent of land thief, Johann Rupertâ€™s right wing millitia. It is clear now that white farmers are emboldened to kill, enslave and abuse our people in South Africa by Rupert. When Johann Rupert appeared on Power FM he promised to unleash unspeakable violence on black people. Further adding that he has the power to invoke black-on-black violence. To that BLF reiterates for every 1 black person Rupert kills, we retaliate with 5! Racist land theives have orchestrated black-on-black massacres in South Africa since the 1980s. We can never allow that to happen again. Johann Rupert has declared war on black bodies and BLF reiterates that it is time for our people to defend themselves. The black oppressed community of Langeloop must do what is right, break the chains of the farm and count to five anything white. Settler colonizers have come for our children, BLF reiterates the call for black people to defend our communities and defend our land by any means necessary! Land or Death!
