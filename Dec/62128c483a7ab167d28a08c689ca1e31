By BO Staff Writer The following statement was first published in the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: It has come to the attention of Black First Land First (BLF) that an entity known as the Cape of Good Hope Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) plans to criminalize the Reclaim Clifton protesters. The racist entity plans to harass black people who are fighting racism. The racist organization shall try and use the claim of fighting cruelty against animals as a pretext to unleashing the police against those blacks who performed the sacred duty of cleansing Clifton beach of the evil spirits inhabiting it. BLF warns the SPCA that should it continue with its racist agenda, we shall slaughter five sheep at its different outlets including its head office. We are tired of being insulted by whites in our own country. BLF salutes the slaughtering of the sheep at Clifton beach. We also salute the Black Peopleâ€™s National Crisis Committee (BPNCC) for taking such an initiative to unite black people across the political divide. 2019 is a year of zero tolerance for racism in South Africa (SA). #ReclaimClifton
