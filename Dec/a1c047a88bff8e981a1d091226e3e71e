By BO Staff Writer The following letter was first published in the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: 1. Its six days since our revolutionary comments on self defence at the #MngxitamaHomecoming rally in Ikageng, Tlokwe. 2. I’m not arrested. 3. Black First Land First (BLF) is not banned by the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC). We received a letter asking us to refrain from making our self defence remarks. We have written back asking for a meeting. 4. I repeat, BLF is not deregistered from the IEC. Also, there is no process underway to stop BLF from contesting the 2019 general election. 5. Multiple so-called hate speech cases have been opened against us but none has since passed the stage of the appointment of an investigating officer. 6. Again, its now 6 days. I’m not in jail and would not be going there. 7. I remain suspended by Twitter. The period of my suspension expires in two days. 8. Facebook has imposed a ban on me for 30 days. 9. Thousands are joining our movement. 10. The Bambatha Self Defence Unit is at an advanced stage. #LandOrDeath Andile Mngxitama
