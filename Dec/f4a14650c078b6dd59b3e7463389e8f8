By BO Staff Writer The following statement was first published in the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) supports the occupation of Clifton 4th Beach. This is a response to the racist arrogance of whites in Cape Town. The colonial and apartheid legacy ensured that whites enjoy private amenities and whites still enjoy and want to preserve such privileges. All this at the exclusion of the rightful owners of the land, the Black majority. BLF is in solidarity with the comrades occupying Clifton Beach, as a movement whose revolutionary program is cornerstoned by the struggle for land return and ending racism. BLF will be undertaking massive land occupations in 2019 in response to the betrayal by political parties in parliament who refuse to amend the Constitution to ensure Land Expropriation Without Compensation (LEWC). BLF reiterates that the land, air, animals and sea belong to the Black majority and no white has a single right to tell Blacks where to be or not be. #LandOrDeath 27 December 2018 Black First Land First Email:blackfirstlandfirst@gmail.com Zanele Lwana
