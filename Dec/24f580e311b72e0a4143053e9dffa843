By BO Staff Writer There is now peace between the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and Vodacom. The two parties met at the EFF headquarters in Braamfontein where they emerged as friend who have “mutual interests”. So from now on, there will be no further trashing of Vodacom by the Red Ants. Insiders say Vodacom paid “hush” money to the red overalls. The sudden meeting of hearts between Vodacom and EFF is said to have been oiled by promises of money by the global telecommunications giant. The sources close to the EFF say there is also secret talk of share options to be given to the captured reds. In the meeting, the EFF didn’t raise the burning issue of high data costs nor did they address the scandal around the theft of the “Please Call Me” intellectual property from the inventor, Nkosana Makate.  The manner in which peace has been reached between the parties suggests that the accusation that the EFF is not fighting white monopoly capital but defending its “lootist leaders” is correct. What angered the EFF enough for fighters to go and trash their stores is not high data costs which affect the poor or the Makate matter. The EFF was angered because Vodacom made negative comment about its leaders. The manner in which the EFF unleashed its members on Vodacom outlets in defence of its leaders shows that the party is nothing but a private militia of its leaders. The EFF only fights to protect the corruption of its leaders. EFF leaders have perfected the art of threatening white monopoly capital to extract bribes. Our sources confirm that this is not the first time. The sources point to the threats to occupy ABSA which came to naught. It is said ABSA paid some money to buy peace. Now Vodacom has done the same and Malema is smiling all the way to the bank.
