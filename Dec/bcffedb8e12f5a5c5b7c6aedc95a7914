By BO Staff Writer The following statement was first published in the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) President Andile Mngxitama has been banned from social media platforms, Twitter and Facebook. The BLF website (www.blf.org.za) and the pro-black online news platform, Black Opinion (www.blackopinion.co.za) have also been shutdown. BLF President has been the main figure in the fight against White Monopoly Capital (WMC) in South Africa. This includes directly confronting the corrupt Johann Rupert, the Oppenheimers and their entire Stellenbosch cabal while confronting imperialism. The latest cyber attacks are attributed to the exposing of Johann Rupert as a racist land thief who perpetuates black-on-black violence for profit and in the interest to sustain white racism. BLF intelligence has discovered that the current attacks emanate from the United States of America. It is clear that the WMC ring leaders, Oppenheimer and Rupert have international assistance, which saw to President Mngxitamaâ€™s Facebook and Twitter shutdown. BLF warns both the west and WMC, we will not stop until the oppressed is liberated from US-led Imperialism and Rupert-led settler colonialism. BLF will innovatively use new ways of communication and continue to shake the ground from Tlokwe to Zimbabwe, inorder to unite the oppressed to take back the land and economy.
