By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued on Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) congratulates Comrade Nicolás Maduro on his election as the Venezuelan president for the second term. His democratic re-election by the Venezuelan people is a victory in the fight against western imperialism. It keeps the dream of Hugo Chavez alive. BLF notes that the United States (US) led western imperialist forces are determined to unseat Maduro as they have done with Dilma Rousseff in Brazil, Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe and Jacob Zuma in South Africa. They have been consistently undermining the democratic process including the legitimate elections in Venezuela. BLF also congratulates the Venezuelan people for their principled solidarity and deep commitment to democracy in these difficult times. They have returned Maduro and honored the legacy of Chavez. BLF stands with Comrade Maduro and the people of Venezuela – Chavez lives! Viva la revolución!
