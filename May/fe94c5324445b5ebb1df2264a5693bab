By BO Staff Writer It looks like a classical case of karma coming back to bite you, for the Deputy President of South Africa (SA) DD Mabuza. It is not clear at this stage whether Mabuza had relapsed from the poisoning episode that he had experienced last year or if he was poisoned again. Sources say that things got so bad that Mabuza went back to the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, with his sick tail between his legs and asked for his life to be saved for the second time. Mabuza has in fact confirmed that he was on a previous occasion poisoned and was assisted by the Guptas who flew him to Russia on their private jet. It is no secret that Putin is close to Zuma and therefore would have preferred the Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma (NDZ) ticket to win at the 54th African National Congress (ANC) elective conference. It was Mabuza who, in a brazen display of ingratitude and disloyalty, spat on the faces of both the Gupta family and Putin and ensured that the anti BRICS candidate emerged at the ANC conference. But as they say, karma is a bitch. After Mabuza fell seriously ill again recently, he remembered who helped him on the last occassion and called out to Moscow. Sources say that the Deputy President of SA has improved enough and would be returning from Russia today.
