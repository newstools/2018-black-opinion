By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) is informed that the racist settler colonialist group called AfriForum is currently in Europe to gather support against blacks in South Africa (SA). We have already called for the banning of all colonial and apartheid organizations – AfriForum is one of those! The so-called tour by this organisation is nothing but a campaign for economic terrorism. AfriForum thinks it can sabotage the economy via sanctions and investment strikes by global capital to force blacks to stop demanding their land. We don’t care for investments by imperialism. The land is ours and we have resolved to take it back! BLF wants to send a clear message to AfriForum (which is in fact Euroforum) – stay in Europe, your motherland. Do not come back! If you come back, we shall not be held accountable when lions eat you. You are no longer welcome in our country. You are rude and arrogant visitors who have usurped our land rights. We call on AfriForum not to return to SA – you have done enough damage already. BLF will monitor those who meet with this extremist group. The European friends of AfriForum are our enemies! Land or death! Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee of (BLF NCC)
