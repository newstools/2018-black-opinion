By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) supports the call for township businesses to be owned by township people themselves. Its totally unacceptable that blacks in the townships do not own even a spaza shop anymore. BLF calls on the North Region Business Association not to target and attack African “foreigners” being those Afrikans who come from outside South Africa (SA). The focus must go to the malls in the townships. White monopoly capital (WMC) has destroyed township economies for its own selfish motives. BLF is seeking meetings with foreign business associations and cooperatives to find a mutually beneficial solutions. We are also preparing to launch the “Our Townships – Our Economies” campaign together with a charter so as to protect township economies while harnessing business relations to combat afrophobia. As we observe Africa Month, it is important that we find creative solutions to our challenges. Radical Economic Transformation (RET) starts where you are.
