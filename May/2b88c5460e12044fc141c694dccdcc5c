By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: It has come to the attention of our movement that Comrade Phapano Phasha has been hounded by mischievous elements inside and outside her political home, the African National Congress (ANC). Black First Land First (BLF) wishes to categorically state that Comrade Phasha is not a member of our movement and has anyway never sought membership or affiliation in this regard.  Rogue elements are using an old picture of Comrade Phasha which was taken during the BLF land imbizo last year. The imbizo was a nonpartisan gathering to which all the political parties of black people, including the ANC, were invited. The BLF regalia she wore on that day was in solidarity with the land question and radical economic transformation (RET). BLF members have also, on occasion, exchanged BLF t-shirts with those of ANC as acts of solidarity on the land question. BLF calls on the rogue elements to stop the political harassment of Comrade Phasha via lies and slander.
