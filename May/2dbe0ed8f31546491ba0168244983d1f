The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) takes the denial of apartheid being a crime against humanity as insulting the dignity of black people and an act of racism. Apartheid was declared a crime against humanity by the United Nations. The International Criminal Court has also expressed in its statutes that apartheid is a crime against humanity. The racist AfriForum/Euroforum continues with its racist activities unabated. BLF will no longer tolerate the racism of this group. AfriForum/Euroforum has now revved up its racism by denying that apartheid is a crime against humanity. Denialism of the holocaust is a crime in Germany, correctly so. BLF in Gauteng will be undertaking several actions against AfriForum including opening a case of racism with the Equality Court on Thursday, engaging in protest actions and writing letters to parliament to have this group banned. If parliamant and the courts do not act, BLF will stop the racism of AfriForum by any means necessary. BLF regards the denialism of apartheid as a declaration of war against black people.
