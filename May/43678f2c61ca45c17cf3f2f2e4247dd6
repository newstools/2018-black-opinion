By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published in the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Twenty six Black First Land First members (also known as the #BLF26) will appear again this morning in the Pretoria Regional Court – located at the corner of Francis Baard & Sophie De Bruyn Street in Pretoria – on empty allegations of public violence, trespassing, assault, and kidnapping.  The BLF26 were arrested on July 18, 2016, after engaging in protest action at the office of the former Public Protector, Thuli Madonsela, who did not want to investigate a complaint lodged with her in 2011 of R26 billion stolen by apartheid era white capitalists; as well as a complaint of state capture by white monopoly capital  (WMC) involving Johann Rupert and others. Instead of the real criminals of white corruption being arrested, Madonsela got the police to arrest the BLF26. During her tenure Thuli Madonsela investigated so called black corruption to distract the publics attention from white corruption. Johann Rupert has since rewarded Madonsela for defending WMC by giving her a very prestigious position at the University of Stellenbosch where he is the Chancellor. The BLF26 maintains their innocence. A trial date has not yet been set by the court.
