The following statement was previously published in the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Tomorrow, Black First Land First (BLF) will appear before the Equality Court, Johannesburg in the matter relating to the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC), Lucy Strydom and BLF & six others under the case number 11/2018 EQ JHB​​​​​​​. In their bid to ensure the black oppressed do not enjoy representation in the white captured parliament, white monopoly capital has intensified its campaign to stop BLF from contesting the 2019 national elections. The Oppenheimers recently shutdown BLF’s crowdfunding campaign on the Back-A-Buddy platform and more recently ABSA has indicated they will look to steal the money that the poor have donated to #TakeBLFtoParliament. This attack by SAHRC, is but one of the countless attacks, and no expense has been spared as the SAHRC has provided financial support for the racist Lucy Strydom via legal representation. BLF is in no way shaken by the multi-pronged attacks by white capital and views these as war against the oppressed. BLF counts itself as the voice of radical economic transformation, and will fight white capital anywhere, and by any means. The hearing will take place under the following details: Date: 13 November 2018
Time: 09h00
Venue: Johannesburg Magistrate Court – 26 Fox St, Ferreiras Dorp, Johannesburg Further note Black Opinion has been granted permission to broadcast the proceedings, and you can follow via both their twitter @BlackOpinion2 and Facebook Black Opinion accounts.
