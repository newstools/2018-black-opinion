By BO Staff Writer The following statement was published on the Black First Land First website: BLF raises R40 000 in second week of #TakeBLFToParliament Week 2 report: We are happy to report that in the 2nd week of the #TakeBLFToParliament campaign donations have come to R40 000. This means that donations that have been received to date are R100 000. This excludes the pledges which stand at R100 000. Black First Land First (BLF) is fundraising for the deposit of R600 000 to be sent to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) by the end of January 2019 to enable it to contest the forthcoming general election. In the intervening period, we have again experienced sabotage from white monopoly capital. As you may know, the Oppenheimers successfully shutdown our crowdfunding page on the Back-a-buddy platform and more recently, ABSA has approached the courts to allow them to steal the money we have already collected. Finally, the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) continues to support the racist, Lucy Strydom in her quest to prevent BLF from going to parliament. We ask you to continue to support this important campaign as we have also launched an easier method to donate, using cellphone banking money transfer services like FNB e-Wallet, ABSA Cashsend, Nedbank Send-iMali and
via Standard Bank Instant Money. We thank all those who have been spreading the word to promote the campaign. Itâ€™s our revolution. We must fund it! #TakeBLFtoParliament
