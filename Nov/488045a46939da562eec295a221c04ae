By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published in the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) congratulates President Maduro of Venezuela and his revolutionary government for the delivery of 2.3 million homes to the poor which was officially announced at a ceremony held in Caracas for that purpose. This accomplishment in the delivery of housing is in spite of the assault on the Venezuelan economy by imperialist forces that the country is perpetually facing. We also welcome the announcement by President Maduro to deliver 700,000 more homes by 2019 to reach the target of three million. The delivery of housing in Venezuela is part of elaborating the social programs set for 2018 that is expected to reach four million households. Other milestones reached include increasing the minimum wage by almost seventy five percent, and expanding the food program (‘CLAP’) which entails door-to-door delivery of basic foods to the poor. Furthermore eligible households receive monthly grants for basic necessities which is determined by the size of the household. To this end a household of two people is eligible BsF320,000 in Venezuelan currency while a household of three gets BsF490,000 after which an amount of about BsF170,000 is added for each additional member of the family. Moreover pregnant women and people living with disabilities are entitled to a monthly payment of BsF700,000. The Venezuelan government’s objective of building 2 million houses by the end of this year has been exceeded beyond expectations. The target of the said 2 million houses, which was set by the former President Hugo Chavez, was realized by President Maduro with honor. In fact the 2.3 million houses delivered by Maduro is 300 000 houses in excess of the objective. We note that enemy forces are serious about unseating President Maduro as they have done with President Jacob Zuma in South Africa. To this end we commend the Venezuelan people and their revolutionary government for their principled unity and deep commitment to ending capitalist imperialism. BLF is encouraged by the ability of the Maduro government to elaborate the state to respond to peoples’ needs, including housing, thus keeping the dream of Hugo Chavez alive. Viva la revolución!
