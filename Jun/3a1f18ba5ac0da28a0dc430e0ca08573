By BO Staff Writer The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has failed to submit its appeal against the unfreezing of assets worth R250 million belonging to Gupta-linked businesses. Last month the Bloemfontein High Court ruled that the state must return the properties, cars and money of the Guptas which were frozen in a dramatic media fanfare. The High Court was not satisfied that there was enough evidence linking the Gupta assets to the Estina Dairy Project. The failure of the NPA to meet the deadline to appeal what it had termed as a “devastating ruling” against it, gives credence to the claim that the Guptas are being targeted. This failure by the NPA to lodge an appeal shows that the High Court was abused for political reasons. The state seems to have bowed to pressure from white monopoly capital to punish the Guptas at all costs. The state never had a case against the Guptas. The NPA seems to have taken the view of short term gains against long term consequences. For some time, humiliating the Guptas satisfied the desire for revenge by white monopoly capital but in the long run, it will compromise the credibility of the NPA itself. Hopefully, the NPA has learned its lessons and will not be allowing itself to be bullied by white monopoly capital again.
