By BO Staff Writer There is a big rift between Zimbabwe’s new President, Emmerson Mnangagwa, and former Chief of the Army, Constantino Chiwenga, over the missing 15 billion relating to the value of diamonds that were looted in the Eastern mining area of Marange. Mnangagwa told Chiwenga to let bygones be bygones but this did not go down well with Chiwenga who insisted that investigations must be carried out to determine how that money disappeared. Mnangagwa told Chiwenga that investigations into the missing money at this stage will affect ZANU-PF politically, since it will suck more bigwigs in the party which will weaken it against the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) in the coming general elections. Chiwenga is said to be under pressure from the military commanders who want to see him fulfilling what they agreed on at King George VI (KGVI) army headquarters before the coup. Mnangagwa is reported to have offered to resign but Chiwenga told him point blankly that if he takes that route, then the government will reinstate his cases, which were compiled by Robert Mugabe’s government, for investigation. Things are not well in Lacoste. As we speak now, Mnangagwa is depressed to a point of being suspected of contemplating suicide. Chiwenga has secretly ordered tight security around him.
