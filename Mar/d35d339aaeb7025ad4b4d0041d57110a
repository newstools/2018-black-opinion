By BO Staff Writer Some Congolese nationals have been deported from the United States of America (USA) via a private jet in chains. To this end Saul Mbenga shared a shocking video on Facebook and wrote thus: “A bad image for the USA is emerging in Africa. Inhumane treatment of people being deported to make many remember slavery and racism. It’s a shame. Please deport with dignity, no need to shackle people like this. I am saddened by these images. The United States expelled/deported Congolese (DRC) refugees handcuffed like slaves and wearing diapers to prevent them using the wash room! Upon arriving to Kinshasa, the Congolese Minster of Human rights ordered the same private jet to take them back to the US and government filed a lawsuit for human rights abuse by the US Government!”.
