By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) mourns the death of Marielle Franco in solidarity with the world, especially the poor and marginalized in Brazil. Marielle was shot four times in the head by assailants in a passing vehicle after leaving a gathering of young black activists. Her driver, Anderson Pedro Gomes, was also killed. Marielle was a staunch black feminist, a courageous advocate for marginalized people and a committed activist in the struggle against state violence and the armed forceâ€™s policing of black bodies. Brazil draws a painful comparison with South Africa, where a black majority remains oppressed by a white minority, both nations have the most unequal societies in the world and black women disproportionately live in a state of expendability. BLF supports the call for an Independent Commission comprised of international human rights figures to carry out an independent investigation into the murder of Marielle Franco with the full co-operation of state judicial and police authorities. We stand with the Brazilian people and demand justice for the murder of Marielle Franco and every single black woman who has been silenced in resistance.
