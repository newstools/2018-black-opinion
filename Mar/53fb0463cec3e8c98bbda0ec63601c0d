By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) welcomes the call by the Australian government for white land thieves to leave South Africa. However, BLF is totally opposed to the call that these land thieves must go to Australia. The colonial settler government of Australia has no right to invite more settler colonialists to Australia, a country that they have stolen from the indegenious people! South African white farmers are land thieves from Europe. They must return to Europe. BLF will be writing to the legitimate owners of Australia to warn them about the possible second invasion of their territory. BLF seeks to form relations with the Australian Aboriginal people. Land expropriation without compensation in South Africa is not a license for land thieves to go and invade other territories. They must go back to Europe!
