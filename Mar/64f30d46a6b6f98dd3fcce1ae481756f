By BO Staff Writer The President of Black First Land First (BLF) Andile Mngxitama has once again been banned from Facebook for thirty days. Banning Mngxitama for no good reason has become a pattern of conduct on the part of Facebook that clearly demonstrates that it is intentionally targeting the President of BLF. The latest banning order follows what seems like a generally acceptable social media language. Mngxitama seemed to be banned for using the words “stupid white friend”. This is a shocking form of censorship in a country where courts have said that freedom of speech allows for such expressions as “fuck white people”. Facebook seems to be following a fascist censorship protocol to target black leaders. BLF has vowed to visit the offices of Facebook in Johannesburg to get to the bottom of the matter. Mngxitama is banned almost every month for very flimsy reasons. More specifically he is allowed on Facebook for short periods of time followed mostly on each occasion by a long period of banning. Facebook has created the environment where Mngxitama’s ideological opponents can use it to shut Mngxitama out. This is censorship pure and simple. Facebook is getting worse as a platform for diverse views. Increasingly only pro white views are allowed.
