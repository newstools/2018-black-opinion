By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: The people of Eshowe carried out brave revolutionary acts of justice today. The racist white farmers kill blacks like we are animals. We are tired of living under terrorism in our own land. The murderers who again murdered must never set foot on the farm. It now belongs to the people! The facts in summary are that two black people were fishing in a river when one of the racist land thieves opened fire and murdered a young man in cold blood – killed for fishing. The community then responded with holy fire. It is prophesied in the holy bible that the sinner who refuses to repent shall be baptized with fire – see Matthew 3:11. Black First Land First (BLF) welcomes the actions of the community. No politician, police or constitution will protect us blacks. We therefore have a God-given duty to defend ourselves. Farms where the murders of black people take place must be expropriated without compensation by the community. BLF is inspired by the revolutionary actions of the people of Eshowe. If we want freedom, we must charge forward like the brave blacks of Eshowe!
