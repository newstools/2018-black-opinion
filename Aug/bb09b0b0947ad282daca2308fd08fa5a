By BO Staff Writer The following article was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) condemns the attempted assassination on Saturday of the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, at the instance of US imperialism via the outgoing Colombian President, Juan Manuel Santos, in cahoots with the Venezuelan right wing connected to the 2002 coup and other acts of terrorism. More specifically it is evident that the attempted assassination – which occurred in Caracas at the 81st anniversary celebration of the conception of the Bolivarian National Guard and while President Maduro was delivering his closing speech – was aimed at stopping the implementation of radically new measures to transform the economy that the Maduro government had already announced and which is scheduled to be launched on August 20 this year. This act of aggression, which is in fact an attempted violent rupture of the democratic order of Venezuela, was timely intercepted and thus failed. BLF applauds the Maduro government for dismantling all conspiracies to undermine the sovereignty of Venezuela by destabilizing its democratic order; and the National Armed Forces for dealing appropriately with the situation in preventing the imperialist attack via Colombia. BLF sends well wishes and solidarity to the Maduro government and the people of Venezuela. We believe that the Maduro government will continue to triumph because it is indeed on the people’s side; and on the right side of history which are the correct paths of the Bolivarian Revolution. #HandsOffVenezuela #HandsOffPresidentMaduro #DownWithImperialism Issued by the National Coordinating Committee of Black First Land First (BLF NCC) 7 August 2018 Black First Land First Email:blackfirstlandfirst@gmail.com
