By BO Staff Writer The following statement was previously published on the Black First Land First website and is now reissued by Black Opinion: Black First Land First (BLF) continues to stand with Mme Olivia Makete, our comrade, our leader and a dedicated activist of radical transfromation. Mme Olivia Makete was violently attacked by Cyril Ramaphosa’s ANC supporters outside Luthuli House on the 5th of February, 2018. Following the violent ordeal, BLF was digusted by Ramaphosa’s silence and his utter indifference to violence against a black woman and elderly citizen. One of Mme Makete’s vile perpetrators was identified as branch secretary of the African National Congress (ANC), Thabang Setona, who she will face tomorrow in court. The details of the court appearance are as follows: Time: 9am
Date: 15 August 2018
Venue: Johannesburg Magistrate Court 1 BLF urges the public to come and support Mme Makete and send a strong message to Cyril’s uncultured, violent ANC. BLF unequivocally shuns those who violate black women and we will stand with Mme Makete until she gets justice in this case including compensation for her physical and emotional trauma.
